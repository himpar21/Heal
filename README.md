Problem Statement
Nowadays it is very tough to carry reports and prescriptions of every medical visit. Carrying files is very hectic and sometimes files can get misplaced. So here we have come up with a website which will help the patient and doctor to maintain a record of every visit.
Every doctor will have the access to the patient’s medical record using the unique ID which will be their Aadhar Number. 
The doctor will be able to view the following things:
1) Discharge Summary
2) Medical Record
3) Operation Notes
4) E-Pharmacy
5) Lab Master
6) X-Ray Data
7) ECG Graphs
8) Receipts

Discharge Summary
A discharge summary is a summary of a patient's hospital stay, written by a doctor, from admission through release. It is a communication tool that aids in clarifying the patient's experience for physicians working outside of the hospital.
Discharge Summary will include the following features:
1)	Significant findings:
2)	Procedures and treatment provided:
3)	Patient's discharge condition:
4)	Patient and family instructions 
5)	Attending physician's signature

Medical Record
Every medical record of patient will include the patient’s health, history and medical examination findings. It will also include the patients ongoing and previous medication as well as any medical allergies. 
The medical record will include the following items:
1)	Identification
2)	Medical History
3)	Medication Information
4)	Family History
5)	Treatment History
6)	Medical Directives
7)	Consent Forms
8)	Progress Notes
9)	Financial Information

Operation Notes
Operation notes will provide an insight into the operative process and stand as a legal document of a surgical procedure occurring. Maintaining accurate, complete and legible notes is fundamental for post-operative patient care and medico-legal purposes.
The remainder of the operation note can be broken down into the following five main parts.
1)	Incision and approach
2)	Findings
3)	Procedure
4)	Closure
5)	Postoperative instructions

E-Pharmacy
Online Pharmacy is going to be the next big evolution that will impact billions of lives and bring a healthy behavioral change to safer and more convenient tomorrow.


ECG Graph
An ECG recording machine will usually show your heart rhythm and electrical activity as a graph displayed electronically or printed on paper.


Lab Master
Lab reports are written to describe and analyze a laboratory experiment that explores a scientific concept. They are typically assigned to enable you to: Conduct scientific research. Formulate a hypothesis about a particular stimulus, event, and/or behavior.
Lab Master will have following features:
1)	Demographic and clinical characteristics
2)	Laboratory and radiologic findings
3)	Clinical outcomes
4)	Treatment and complications

X-Ray Data
An X-ray is a quick, painless test that produces images of the structures inside your body — particularly your bones. X-ray beams pass through your body, and they are absorbed in different amounts depending on the density of the material they pass through.
This section lists what the radiologist saw in each area of the body in the exam. Your radiologist notes whether they think the area to be normal, abnormal, or potentially abnormal.

Receipts
A medical bill receipt is one that a doctor's office or other medical institution will issue following the payment of an invoice.
Receipt will include the following feature:
1)	Patient Service Revenue
2)	Research Revenue
3)	Direct and Indirect
4)	Academic Revenue
5)	Other Revenue

Technology Used:
	For Design
	Figma
	For Website
	HTML
	CSS
	React.js
